This file contains all the broken/planned things to do within
The GNU Netcat project.

If you wish to contribute about one of these points, feel free
to mail me if you need any further information.



    TODO/bugs in Netcat
==================================

 o Write the README file!

 o I need to study deeply the -g/-G options issue in order to make
   it working properly.

 o I need to fetch information about the history of this tool,
   so I can give credits to the right people for the design and
   the original code.

 o If some more critical uncompatibilities will jump out, add
   a configure option `--enable-compat' that implies ALL other
   single options like `--enable-oldhexdump'.

 o The configure script must properly check res_init() by including
   the <resolv.h> file.

 o Make it compiling on SunOS. It requires -lsocket -lnsl -lresolv.



    Future features/Planning
==================================

 o Add IPv6 support

    o This should be controlled by a command line switch like
      `-6' and `-4'.

    o Netcat should also be able to tunnel ipv6/ipv4 in tunnel
      mode

 o Add command line switch -X, --input-hexdump so that read from
   stdin some valid hexdump-style data, and accepts it in some
   standard forms (more than one)
